Not to confuse &amp;ldquo;block comments&amp;rdquo; (using #) with docstring comments.
Next developers generation will be thankfully with your graceful documentation (or not, but you must write it anyway)
I&amp;rsquo;ve started using this plugin for vscode: Python Docstring Generator(njpwerner.autodocstring) with snippets for docstrings, but also Pycharm generates docstring automatically.</description></item><item><title>Don't we need DS?

I think this article will be a trigger of next datascience courses DS is attracting more and more people every day, also from a different domains. Sometimes, those people doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a PhD or a degree, and of course they could solve ML/DL problems because they are smart! (such Elon Musk :-) ). ML/DL/AI are the new buzzword, and all people want it, though they don&amp;rsquo;t know why or how&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Python: some advance topics</title><link>https://jonathanloscalzo.github.io/2021/01/python-some-advance-topics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2021 18:10:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://jonathanloscalzo.github.io/2021/01/python-some-advance-topics/</guid><description>Links Async-Await Async IO - Real Python python async features - Real Python GIL and concurrency The Python interpreter is not fully thread-safe, in order to support multithreading there is a &amp;ldquo;global lock&amp;rdquo; in CPython.

I gathered them because these are not technical topics per se, are more related to theory or part of the ecosystem.
When I will able to add more, I will do.

Metrics:
Mean Squared Error - MSE Root Mean Squared Error - RMSE Mean Absolute Error - MAE R squared - RÂ² MSE: Mean Squared Error It is the average between the differece of prediction and real data, squared. It is a loss function, so to optimize we will try to minimize it.</description></item></channel></rss>
