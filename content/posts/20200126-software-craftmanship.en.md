# Ideas
Software Craftmanship, Agile, Kaisen(kanban), Lean Startup... All these concepts has several related topics.

I generally want to apply them on projects where I usually work.

- Software is a result of programmer/developer creativity 
- Software Quality is one of the most important attribute 
- Continuous Improvement: always we are able to do things better
- People are not pieces or artifacts that we could move as is.
- Iterative and Incremental development, with constant feedback (people and software).
- Always satisfy the customer's need
- Remove waste:
    - We must monitor and detect issues, such inefective practices.
- Always start with a MVPs o POCs, 
    - Materialize instead of Imagine
    - Go to production must be one of the tasks at the beginning stages
- The software process must have a set of minimum practices: 
    - Testing and Coverage
    - Versioning
    - CI/CD
    - Documentation (or auto documentation), 
    - Force standards (linter, typing)
    - Code Analysis (bad smells detector: unused code, security issues)
    - Always use package managers (or alternatives)
    - Define step for releasing (incrementar versiones, tags, etc...)
    - Define containers or alternatives for executing everywhere
    - Configuration and Constants must be save in files 
        - (dotenv, configparser)
        - also must have conf files per environment (dev, test, stage, prod)
        - except for those which have to be secure! 
    - Always set strategies for backup, monitoring, performance issues, caching...
    - Software projects must be
        - scalable 
        - robust y maintainable
        - fault tolerant
        - resilient
        - incremental changes
- Monitor to take smart decisiones (Build-Measure-Learn, Plan-Do-Check-Act)
- Understand the problem 
    - initially divergent thinking, then convergent thinking
    - 5 Ws
    - Una solución simple y elegante es mejor que una solución compleja

- "fast" is not "fast and dirty" else "fast and well, fresh, cool..."
    - steady pace is better that fast and dirty
- be professional
- practice to be better, always.
