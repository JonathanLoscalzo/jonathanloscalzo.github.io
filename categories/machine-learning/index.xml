I think this article will be a trigger of next datascience courses DS is attracting more and more people every day, also from a different domains. Sometimes, those people doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a PhD or a degree, and of course they could solve ML/DL problems because they are smart! (such Elon Musk :-) ). ML/DL/AI are the new buzzword, and all people want it, though they don&amp;rsquo;t know why or how&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Diverse Topics in Machine Learning</title><link>https://jonathanloscalzo.github.io/2020/11/diverse-topics-in-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 13:58:29 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://jonathanloscalzo.github.io/2020/11/diverse-topics-in-machine-learning/</guid><description>Diverse Topics in ML I am going to gather diverse topics regarding to ML, but I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss none of them. I gathered them because these are not technical topics per se, are more related to theory or part of the ecosystem.
When I will able to add more, I will do.

Metrics:
Mean Squared Error - MSE Root Mean Squared Error - RMSE Mean Absolute Error - MAE R squared - RÂ² MSE: Mean Squared Error It is the average between the differece of prediction and real data, squared. It is a loss function, so to optimize we will try to minimize it.</description></item></channel></rss>
